# This project is of very basic level.
# Here it simply uses basic string concatenation concept of python
# We can concatenate strings in python in following ways:
# for e.g. we just want to print a hello message to a person.

person_name = "Yashwant"
print("Hello "+person_name)
print("How are you {}?".format(person_name))
print("%s is a good boy."%person_name)
print(f"I wish you all the best {person_name}.")

print("\n")

# print ('Hello World')
# n = input('Name: ')
# a = input('Adjective: ')

n = 'Yashwant'
a = 'coder'

print(f'{n} is trying to be a good {a}')
print('Hi '+n+'\nHow are you '+n+'?')
